hey, i'm CraigTucker.
I'm trying to develop FoolsAdrift, which is way cooler than WorldsAdrift or any related fan projects
FoolsAdrift is being developed in UE4, might move to UE5

You have skills that might be useful and liked WorldsAdrift enough to spend your time on a project that might go nowhere?
Then please reach out to OneFaceMan#1111 on Discord! 
see you in the Skies, Fools!
